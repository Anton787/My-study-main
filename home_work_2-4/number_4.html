    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <span class="formula">ax + b = 0</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      where <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span> are real
      numbers and <span class="math">x</span> is a variable. This form is
      sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most
      linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may
      or may not be an <span class="math">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into
      always seeing an <span class="math">x</span> there.
    </p>

    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>

    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      <span class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      where <span class="math">a</span>, <span class="math">b</span>,
      <span class="math">c</span> are known values and
      <span class="math">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it
      yet). Also, <span class="math">a</span> can't be 0.
    </p>

    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="math">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="math"
        >r</span
      >) squared:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      <span class="formula">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="math">D</span>):</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <span class="formula">A = (&pi;/4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></span
      >
    </p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="math">C</span>):</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <span class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> /4 &times; &pi;</span
      >
    </p>
    <h3>Intersection</h3>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets <span class="math">A</span> and
      <span class="math">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all
      objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <span class="formula">A &cap; B = {x:x &isin; A and x &isin; B</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, <span class="math">x</span> is an element of the intersection A
      &isin; B if and only if <span class="math">x</span> is both an element of
      <span class="math">A</span> and an element of <span class="math">B</span>.
